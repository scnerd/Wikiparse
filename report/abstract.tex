This paper presents Wikiparse, a Python 3 toolset and module for caching and inspecting Wikipedia page content. Tools are included for downloading and unpacking the entirety of Wikipedia's articles into an intuitive and efficient directory structure. A Java parser and Python module are included for converting the poorly defined wikitext syntax into an easily usable JSON tree, similar to an abstract syntax tree, that describes the same content in an easily-parsed, language- and platform-independent format for easy use within applications. All tools are oriented toward a Natural Language Processing perspective of Wikipedia articles, focused on preserving all textual content without loss of ease of use.
